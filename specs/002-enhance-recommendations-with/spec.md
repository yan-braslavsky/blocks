# Feature Specification: Enhanced Recommendations & Mock Dashboard Experience

**Feature Branch**: `002-enhance-recommendations-with`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Enhance recommendations with additional stubs, CTA enable/purchase button, and mock dashboard timelines UI using mock data"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors (tenant user, evaluator, potential buyer admin), actions (view recommendations, explore timeline dashboards, click CTA to enable/purchase), data (recommendation stubs, timeline mock metrics), constraints (mock data only now, no real billing enablement yet)
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (Recommendation Stub, Dashboard Timeline Block)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
All ambiguities have been explicitly marked below.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tenant user evaluating the product, I want to view richer recommendation entries (with clearer labels and future capability placeholders) and an attractive dashboard containing multiple timeline visualizations so that I understand potential value and am prompted to enable or purchase the feature set.

### Secondary Stories
1. As an admin / decision maker, I want a clear call-to-action to enable or purchase the recommendations module so I know how to proceed from evaluation to activation.
2. As a returning evaluator, I want consistent mock data so I can revisit the dashboard without confusion caused by random changes (unless variation communicates breadth of insights).
3. As a product marketer / internal stakeholder, I want the mock dashboard to communicate breadth (multiple timelines / metrics) without implying guaranteed real data fidelity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a tenant with the feature in mock/evaluation state, When the user navigates to the recommendations area, Then they see a list/grid of recommendation stubs (minimum 5 distinct categories) each with: title, short description, impact label, status label (e.g., "Prototype" or "Coming Soon").
2. Given the same view, When the page loads, Then a prominent CTA button (e.g., "Enable Recommendations" or "Purchase") is visually distinct and accessible.
3. Given the dashboard view, When the user scrolls or scans the page, Then they see at least 3 timeline style visual blocks (e.g., spend over time, performance trend, projection curve) populated with deterministic mock data.
4. Given the CTA is clicked in evaluation mode, When the user triggers it, Then a non-destructive confirmation pattern appears (modal or inline panel) explaining next steps (since real enablement not wired yet) and no production configuration is changed.
5. Given assistive technology use, When a screen reader encounters the recommendation list and CTA, Then semantic labels and focus order are logical and all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard.
6. Given the dashboard loads, When network latency is simulated (slow), Then loading skeletons/placeholders appear instead of blank content.

### Edge Cases
- Empty state: What happens if mock dataset fails to load? ‚Üí Display friendly placeholder: "Mock data temporarily unavailable" and still show CTA.
- Duplicate categories: If config accidentally defines duplicate recommendation stubs, they should be de-duplicated by slug before render.
- Long text overflow: Recommendations with very long titles should truncate gracefully with tooltip / accessible full text.
- Accessibility: High contrast mode should preserve CTA visibility (contrast ratio ‚â• target).
- Disabled CTA: If activation already completed (future real state), CTA should be replaced by a success label and link to management settings.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST present at least 5 recommendation stubs with consistent structure (title, description, impact tag, status badge).
- **FR-002**: System MUST include an easily identifiable CTA control prompting activation or purchase of recommendations capabilities.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display at least 3 timeline visualization blocks using deterministic mock data sets (same data each load unless intentionally versioned).
- **FR-004**: System MUST visually differentiate future/unavailable recommendations (e.g., status badge like "Coming Soon") from active prototype ones.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide loading placeholders (skeleton or shimmer) for recommendations list and timeline blocks when data is pending.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure keyboard navigation reaches: recommendation items, CTA, and timeline blocks in logical order.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide accessible names / aria labels for the CTA and each recommendation item.
- **FR-008**: System MUST show a confirmation / informational panel when CTA is invoked (since real enablement is not active yet) and NOT modify production configuration.
- **FR-009**: System MUST de-duplicate recommendation stubs with identical logical IDs before display.
- **FR-010**: System MUST present a graceful user-facing fallback message if mock data retrieval fails.
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow future substitution of mock data with real service responses without modifying consumer UI contracts.
- **FR-012**: System SHOULD visually group timelines under a "Insights Preview" or equivalent heading to set expectation of mock nature.
- **FR-013**: System SHOULD include impact-level color coding (Low / Medium / High) with an accessible legend.
- **FR-014**: System SHOULD avoid implying real cost or risk; include a subtle disclaimer: "Data shown is illustrative only."
- **FR-015**: System MUST not expose personally identifiable or tenant-specific real data in mock mode.
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain consistent mock dataset across sessions within a 24h period (deterministic or cached) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: persistence scope (browser local vs server mock) not specified].
- **FR-017**: System MUST define a method for marking a recommendation as "Activated" in future real state [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: activation state source of truth not specified].

### Non-Functional / Experience Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Initial render (with skeletons) SHOULD occur within 1s on a typical broadband connection.
- **NFR-002**: All visible text and CTA MUST meet accessibility contrast guidelines.
- **NFR-003**: The design SHOULD visually communicate breadth without overwhelming (no more than 6 recommendations above the fold).
- **NFR-004**: Mock visualizations MUST clearly avoid being mistaken for real historical data (legend label or watermark).

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- Mock data source available (static JSON or in-memory objects).
- No billing integration required in this iteration.
- UI framework styling tokens already exist for badges and buttons.
- Accessibility baseline tooling in place for verification.

### Out of Scope (Explicit Non-Goals)
- Real activation workflow (provisioning backend changes).
- Billing or plan upgrade logic.
- Persistence of user personalization / dismiss states.
- Real-time data refresh / live streaming metrics.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Recommendation Stub**: Represents a potential actionable insight preview. Attributes: id (slug), title, shortDescription, impactLevel (enum), status (enum: Prototype | ComingSoon | Future), category (optional grouping), displayOrder.
- **Timeline Block (Mock Visualization)**: Represents a single chart-like preview. Attributes: id, title, metricType (spend | performance | projection | other), timeRange (e.g., last 30 days), dataPoints (array of {timestamp, value}), disclaimerFlag.
- **Activation CTA State**: Conceptual state indicating whether the module is in evaluation (mock) or (future) active mode.
